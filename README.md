This project demonstrates my ability to create a complete web page design. It demonstrates my ability to apply unique styles (such as rounded edges, button borders, and unique fonts). It also demonstrates my ability to manage a complex array of web page elements by organizing those elements using css display properties, such as flexbox. This project also demonstrates my ability to integrate media images into the overall content of the web page. This webpage also shows my understanding of various html tags and how those tags should be integrated in parent-child relationships to create appropriate css styling.
